## To Do Application

This is Easy-to-Use, fast, elegant and secure Full Stack Application. Made using React, this app lets you save the to-do's. The Back-End is made using Node-Express. And the database used is Mongo-Db. The designing tools used in this app are bootstrap and reactstrap and material-ui.

## Description

CRUD operation can be done effectively on tasks/to-do's.
Tasks can have title, label, status, createdAt fields.
Full User Authentication is integrated in this project.
Private Routing is enabled, means you cannot go back to link after login in.
All the unkown link fall back to NoMatch component.
Though full front end is not completed but you can check my repo for Notes Application. It is similar kind of project.(https://github.com/yashjais/Notes-Application)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `nodemon index.js` || `npm dev server`

Runs the back-end app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3020) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You will be needing postman if you only run Backend.

### `npm start`

Runs the front-end app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
